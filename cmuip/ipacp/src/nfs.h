      the user identification number of the owner of the file; "gid" is
      the group identification number of the group of the file; "size"
      is the size in bytes of the file; "blocksize" is the size in bytes
      of a block of the file; "rdev" is the device number of the file if
      it is type NFCHR or NFBLK; "blocks" is the number of blocks the
      file takes up on disk; "fsid" is the file system identifier for
      the filesystem containing the file; "fileid" is a number that
      uniquely identifies the file within its filesystem; "atime" is the
      time when the file was last accessed for either read or write;
      "mtime" is the time when the file data was last modified
