Here we define the fields of the device configuration table.  Each entry
describes a network device plus the assigned IO channel # after device
initialization.  One entry per device.  The fields are initialized by the
invocation of the "device_init" macro (see dec_config definition in
devconfig.bli) at compile time and from the file devconfig.txt during acp initialization.
